## Hello There  <img src="waving-hand-joypixels.gif" width="30px">

**Mostly used technologies**:
- Rust. If I want to create a project, I will be using rust
- Bash. Personally used to automate certain tasks on my machine
- Lua. Used to config neovim and awesomeWM
- Python. Mostly used to create small webscraping and install scripts
- C. Do some random stuff on my machine, hoping to make a nice little project with it.
- C++. I do DSA problems with c++.
- Haskell. Functional programming is the best.

**Technologies with adequate knowledge in**
- React. Tried it, know some hooks, like svelte better
- Golang. No reason to use it, if I can do it in go, I can do it in rust but faster
- Elixir. Trying to add this to the Mostly used technologies
- Java. Boilerplate 
- C#. Might Learn in the future.
- Node. Will maybe learn it, due to high demand
- Vimscript. Learnt through trial and error much like lua while configuring my neovim setup
- Html. Lets be real, we all know html

**Things I want to learn this year**:
- C#
- OCaml

**My machine setup**
- OS - Arch Linux (btw)
- WM - AwesomeWM
- Shell - zsh (soon [vsh](https://github.com/xmantle/vsh))

**Projects Made by yours truly**
- [Vsh](https://github.com/xmantle/vsh), Shell implementation in rust
- [Crpc](https://github.com/Vaimer9/crpc), An application to set Discord Rich presence from the command line using json

**Here's what im doing right now**
