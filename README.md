## Hello There  <img src="waving-hand-joypixels.gif" width="30px">

**Mostly used technologies**:
-  Rust. If I want to create a project, I will be using rust
- Python. Mostly used to create small webscraping and install scripts
- Bash. Personally used to automate certain tasks on my machine
- Svelte. Never made anything big but I know a lot

**Languages with adequate knowledge in**
- React. Tried it, know some hooks, like svelte better
- Golang. No reason to use it, if I can do it in go, I can do it in rust but faster
- Elixier. Trying to add this to the Mostly used technologies
- Lua. Learnt through trial and error by config files
- Java. I like OOP but hate boilerplate :p 
- C#. Used it for some time with unity and some graphics libraries, Like its syntax but then again, boilerplate :p 
- Node. No need to use it, If Im making a project I use rust, If I want to make a script I use python 
- Vimscript. Learnt through trial and error much like lua while configuring my neovim setup
- C. I want to master it, one of my goals in 2022
- C++. No need to use this, Rust is C++ and more
- Html. Lets be real, we all know html

**Libraries used a lot by me**
- Structopt (Rust library for making CLI applications)
- Serde (Rust library for Serialization and Deserialization of data)
- egui (GUI Library for Rust)
- tui (Tui Library for rust)
- Tokio (Rust library for Asynchronous applications)
- Surf (Http library for Rust)
- Bevy (Game library for Rust)
- Rocket.rs (Backend library Rust)

**Dev Tools used by me**
- Neovim. Love of my life, speeds up my workflow by a 1000 times, [my nvim config](https://github.com/Vaimer9/nvim-config)
- Rust Analyzer, best language server for rust
- Git kraken, its free and it works
- Lazygit, its a tui for git, you can't refuse it

**My machine setup**
- OS - Kubuntu
- WM - AwesomeWM (I know its wierd I have kubuntu with awesome but I don't wanna change OS)
- Shell - zsh (soon [vsh](https://github.com/xmantle/vsh))

**Projects Made by yours truly**
