## Hello There  <img src="waving-hand-joypixels.gif" width="30px">

**Mostly used technologies**:
- Rust. If I want to create a project, I will be using rust
- Bash. Personally used to automate certain tasks on my machine
- Lua. Used to config neovim and awesomeWM
- Python. Mostly used to create small webscraping and install scripts

**Currently Learning**:
- C and C++ (mostly C)
- Haskell

**Technologies with adequate knowledge in**
- React. Tried it, know some hooks, like svelte better
- Golang. No reason to use it, if I can do it in go, I can do it in rust but faster
- Elixir. Trying to add this to the Mostly used technologies
- Java. I like OOP but hate boilerplate :p 
- C#. Used it for some time with unity and some graphics libraries, Like its syntax but then again, boilerplate :p 
- Node. No need to use it, If Im making a project I use rust, If I want to make a script I use python 
- Vimscript. Learnt through trial and error much like lua while configuring my neovim setup
- C. I want to master it, one of my goals in 2022
- C++. Unsafe rust :P
- Html. Lets be real, we all know html

**Things I want to learn this year**:
- Elixir
- Nim
- F#

**Dev Tools used by me**
- Neovim. Love of my life, speeds up my workflow by a 1000 times, [my nvim config](https://github.com/Vaimer9/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim)
- Rust Analyzer, best language server for rust
- Lazygit, its a tui for git, you can't refuse it

**My machine setup**
- OS - Arch Linux (btw)
- WM - AwesomeWM
- Shell - zsh (soon [vsh](https://github.com/xmantle/vsh))

**Projects Made by yours truly**
- [Vsh](https://github.com/xmantle/vsh), Shell implementation in rust
- [Crpc](https://github.com/Vaimer9/crpc), An application to set Discord Rich presence from the command line using json
